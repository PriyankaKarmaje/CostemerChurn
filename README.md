## Project Description
This project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant customer and transaction data.
2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to identify patterns.
4. **Model Building:** Developing predictive models to forecast churn.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and tuning hyperparameters.
6. **Deployment:** Implementing the model and monitoring its performance.
7. **Churn Mitigation:** Developing strategies to retain at-risk customers.
